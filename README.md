# 🖼️ Pixel Encryption Tool – Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task #2
 🔐 A Python-based image encryption & decryption tool using **pixel-level XOR manipulation**. This tool helps protect visual data by scrambling image pixels, and can reverse it with the correct key.
## 📜 Task Description
As part of my **Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**, I was assigned to build a tool that:
- Encrypts and decrypts images by manipulating their pixel values
- Uses a basic encryption algorithm (XOR)
- Provides both CLI and GUI versions for user interaction
---
## 🚀 Features
- 🔸 Pixel-wise image encryption using XOR logic
- 🔸 Reversible encryption (same key for decryption)
- 🔸 Supports JPG, PNG, JPEG, BMP, and GIF
- 🔸 Folder-based output organization
- 🔸 Beginner-friendly GUI with file browser
- 🔸 Clean CLI for power users
---
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🖼️ Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- 🎛️ Tkinter for GUI version
---
## 💻 How to Run

```bash
python Pixel-Manipulation.py
```
## 🖱️ GUI Version
```bash
python Pixel-Manipulation-Gui.py
```
## 📦 Dependencies
Install required library using:
```bash
pip install pillow

```
